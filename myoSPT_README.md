# CMCB/myoSPT

this is the basic file package used for single particle tracking of myosin II filaments described in 
Mosby, L., M. Polin, and D.V. Köster. 2020. A Python based automated tracking routine for myosin II filaments. ArXiv. : 2001.10035.

and applied for analysis in: 
Mosby, L., N. Hundt, G. Young, A. Fineberg, M. Polin, S. Mayor, P. Kukura, and D. Köster. 2019. Visualization of myosin II filament dynamics in remodeling acto-myosin networks with interferometric scattering microscopy. bioarXiv. .

we will soon provide a cleaned up version with proper documentation.
